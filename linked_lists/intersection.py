"""Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Given the pointers to the heads of two linked list,
find the intersection of two linked lists

The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B,
is the set of all objects that are members of both sets
A and B. For example, the intersection of A = [1, 2, 3]
and B = [2, 3, 4] is [2, 3].

Input:
A = [1, 2, 3]
B = [2, 3, 4]

Output: SinglyLinkedList([2, 3])
